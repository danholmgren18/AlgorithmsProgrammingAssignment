1. Make sure all classes are included in project:
    Main
    FileMaker
    Reader
    Sorter
2. Create files:
   Uncomment out lines 22 - 32 in the Main method in Main class.
   They are currently commented out to improve run time when I had to restart the final run
3. Sort files and produce output:
    This should be done when doing step 2, but if not simply run the main method again.
    It will call sort on each file and store the output file with the times for each type
    of list in the respective folder i.e. Unsorted Files, Sorted Files, and Reverse Sorted Files
